Our research is at the intersection of genome evolution and crop breeding. We investigate how evolutionary processes shape the structure of crop genomes and populations, and how this genetic variation manifests in the variation of agronomic traits to be leveraged in breeding. We are particularly interested in hybrids, such as allopolyploids, and species that have been domesticated multiple times. Our goal is to reduce the time it takes for improved crop varieties to reach growers by accelerating the efficiency and speed of crop improvement.
